    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Reibekuchen, also called Kartoffelpuffer, are German potato pancakes that are a denser and 
        slightly sweeter version of the Jewish potato latkes. They are a popular street food and 
        are typically served with applesauce or sour cream.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 potatoes</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2tsp ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4c vegetable oil, or more as needed</li>
        <li>applesauce, sour cream, or another savory sauce for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and finely grate potatoes and onion.
        </li>
        <li>Remove any excess moisture with a fine mesh strainer or a nut milk bag. Catch the
        liquid in a bowl and let it sit without moving it too much so the potato starch can 
        separate from the water.
        </li>
        <li>Place drained potatoes and onion in another bowl. Add eggs, salt, pepper, and ground
            nutmeg and stir until combined.
        </li>
        <li>Gently pour leftover water into a small bowl to separate it from the potato starch 
            (the thick white mass sitting at the bottom). Stir potato starch into dough.
        </li>
        <li>Prepare oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add dough in small amounts and shape
            into pancakes one at a time until the surface of the pan is covered.
        </li>
        <li>Fry for 7-10 minutes per side. Remove from pan and place on a plate with paper towel to 
            absorb excess oil. Add more oil if needed and repeat until there is no dough left.
        </li>
        <li>Serve with sauce of choice.</li>
    </ol>
